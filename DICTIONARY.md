# Terminology

The following table introduces terminology used in the fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Engineering and Artificial Intelligence, and most important their use in the field of __Bioinformatics__ to help you start your journey working with algorithms and machine assisted routines to increase your productivity and capability to operate with more complex problems.

Term | Definition | Field
-------- | ----------- | ------
Dataset | A collection of information gathered by observations, measurements, research or analysis | Agnostic
Dataframe | An data structure abstraction that allows analytical operations like filters or aggregations over data points | Data Engineering
CSV | Comma separated file | Data Engineering
TSV | Tab separated file | Data Engineering
XSV | A special character separated file | Data Engineering
File Encoding | Represents how to represent characters when processing text | Data Engineering
File Format | A predefined structure on a data set, like headers and rows, or more sophisticated versions like binary files like movies or audio | Data Engineering
Parquet | Is the most popular file format for analytical workloads that allows operating with millions of rows in commodity hardware like a laptop | Data Engineering
Data Filter | Is a predicate applicable to 1 or many columns in a dataframe that excludes rows that don't match such predicate | Data Engineering
Data Aggregation | Is a data operation typically applied to groups of rows. Typically used for descriptive statistics | Data Engineering
Data Partition | Referred when storing data into folders or groups of rows, so that reading or analytical workloads don't have to operate with large amounts of data | Data Engineering
Data Model | Is an abstraction of multiple entities and their relationships or associations | Data Engineering
ERD | Entity Relationship Diagram | Data Engineering
