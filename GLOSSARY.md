Term | Definition | Field
-------- | ----------- | ------
Affinity | the interaction strength at which the antibody/drug is attracted to the target | Immunology
Antigen receptor | (AR) | Immunoprofiling
AR recombination | the process where a Variable (V), Diversity (D), or Joining (J) gene is combined with a gene from another group.  A heavy chain molecule results when V, D, and J genes combine, while a light chain molecule is formed when only V and J genes combine. | Immunoprofiling
B and T cell epitopes | B cell epitopes are either the conformational or linear part of the protein antigen that antibodies bind to. T cell epitopes are usually protein antigen-derived peptides presented by MHC molecules on antigen-presenting cells and recognized by T cell receptors | Immunology 
Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) | flexible loop regions of diversity in immunoglobulin variable domains that are mainly responsible for antigen binding. Both the VH and VL domains contain three CDR loops. | Immunology
Developability | the drug-like properties of therapeutic antibody candidates, including immunogenicity, solubility, stability, viscosity, charge profiles, post-translational modifications, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, hydrophobicity, and manufacturability. | Pharmacology
Clonality |A number (0 - 1) that describes the fraction of sequences that comme from the clones of a single cell.|Immunology
Directed evolution | a representative method used in protein/antibody engineering through iterative rounds of library screening. For this, phage display technology and yeast display technology are commonly used. | Immunology
Epitope | the region of an antigen that binds to an antibody. | Immunology
Humanization | humanization is required to produce antibodies with reduced immunogenicity risks. Antibody therapeutics are often produced from mice or other non-human organisms and therefore are likely to elicit an immunogenic response in humans. To reduce the immunogenicity, the variable region of a non-human antibody can be fused to human antibody constant region to generate a chimeric antibody. | Immunology
Immunogenicity | an ability of therapeutics to trigger an undesirable immune response against the therapeutics. | Immunology
Immunoprofiling | the quantitative measurement of antigen receptors (ARs; antibodies or T-cell receptors) in a sample. Also called immune profiling. | Immunology
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations | a computer simulation technique for analyzing the physical movements of each individual atoms or molecules. This technique permits the prediction of time evolution of an interacting system involving the generation of atomic trajectories of a system under different conditions, such as temperature, pH, and pressure. | Immunology
Paratope | the region of an antibody that recognizes and binds to the antigen. Scoring functions: physical/ mathematical models that attempt to describe the potential energy of a protein system. | Immunology
Scoring functions | physical/ mathematical models that attempt to describe the potential energy of a protein system. | Immunology
V(D)J gene region | the junction of Variable (V), Diversity (D), and Joining (J) genes along the antigen genome, which when recombined, form a loci of high diversity in the AR.
