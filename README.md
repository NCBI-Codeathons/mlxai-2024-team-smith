## Project Goals
For large numbers of scientists, students, and instructors of machine learning and artificial intelligence the methods and tools are opaque. Understanding the processes from defining data sets to encoding data to choosing appropriate algorithms to verifying a model's predictive, or generative, quality reduce to random trials and machine learning becomes magical learning. These issues exacerbate when peer review (grants and papers) is considered resulting in unfair critiques, or misleading science that cannot be reproduced. To address this issue we need to look at ways we can introduce ML concepts in easy to digest formats that provide hands on instruction.

This project will focus on antibody ML methods. The resulting work will be used in Digital World Biology's National Science Foundation funded summer hackathon (August 2024) on antibody engineering. In the project we will consider ML applications for predicting antibody antigen recognition, genetic contributions to antibody expression, and de novo antibody design. Work will identify one or two examples that include specific datasets, workflows, an appropriate ML method, and tests. The examples will then be used to create instructions and explainers that can be used in classroom settings, starting points for undergraduate research, and scientists wishing they had ways to better understand ML.  "

Project materials will create a resource with instruction and hands on examples that can demystify ML and AI for many scientists and students who need greater awareness of the data, steps, and practicalities. The focus on antibodies  supports work in basic research and biotechnology. Digital World Biology's Antibody Engineering Hackathons are creating materials for course-base undergraduate research in community colleges (https://antibody-engineers.org/).


## Approach
Some cloud computing, jupyter notebooks, tools from SABDAB, oxford protein information group (OPIG). We also want to identify good NCBI datasets.
